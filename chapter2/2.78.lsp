Exercise 2.78: The internal procedures in the scheme-number
package are essentially nothing more than calls to the prim-
itive procedures +, -, etc. It was not possible to use the prim-
itives of the language directly because our type-tag system
requires that each data object have a type attached to it. In
fact, however, all Lisp implementations do have a type sys-
tem, which they use internally. Primitive predicates such
as symbol? and number? determine whether data objects
have particular types. Modify the definitions of type-tag,
contents, and attach-tag from Section 2.4.2 so that our
generic system takes advantage of Schemeâ€™s internal type
system. That is to say, the system should work as before ex-
cept that ordinary numbers should be represented simply
as Scheme numbers rather than as pairs whose car is the
symbol scheme-number.


(define (attach-tag type-tag contents) 
   (if (number? contents) 
       contents 
       (cons type-tag contents)
   )
) 

(define (type-tag datum) 
   (cond ((number? datum) 'scheme-number)
         ((pair? datum) (car datum)) 
         (error "Bad tagged datum -- TYPE-TAG" datum)
   )
)
  
(define (contents datum) 
   (cond ((number? datum) datum) 
         ((pair? datum) (cdr datum)) 
         (error "Bad tagged datum -- CONTENTS" datum)
   )
)
