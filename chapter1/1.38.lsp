Exercise 1.38: In 1737, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard
Euler published a memoir De Fractionibus Continuis, which
included a continued fraction expansion for eâˆ’2, where
e is the base of the natural logarithms. In this fraction, the
Ni are all 1, and the Di are successively 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1,
6, 1, 1, 8,. . .. Write a program that uses your cont-frac
procedure from Exercise 1.37 to approximate e, based on
Eulers expansion.


(define (cont-frac n d k)
    (define (iter i)
        (if (= i k)
            (/ (n i) (d i))
            (/ (n i) (+ (d i) (iter (+ 1 i))))
        )
    )
    (* 1.0 (iter 1))
)


(define (e k)
    (define (d i)
        (if (= 0 (remainder (+ 1 i) 3))
            (* 2 (/ (+ 1 i) 3))
            1
        )
        
    )

    (+ 2 
    (cont-frac
        (lambda (i) 1)
        d
        k
    )
    )
)
