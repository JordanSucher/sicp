Exercise 1.10: e following procedure computes a math-
ematical function called Ackermann’s function.

    (cond 
        ((= y 0) 0)
        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
        ((= y 1) 2)
        (else (A (- x 1) (A x (- y 1))))
    )
)

(* 2 (* 2 (A 0 (A 1 7))))

Consider the following procedures, where A is the proce-
dure defined above:

    (define (f n) (A 0 n))
    (define (g n) (A 1 n))
    (define (h n) (A 2 n))
    (define (k n) (* 5 n n))

Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions com-
puted by the procedures f, g, and h for positive integer val-
ues of n. For example, (k n) computes 5n2

(define (A x y)
    (cond 
        ((= y 0) 0)
        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
        ((= y 1) 2)
        (else (A (- x 1) (A x (- y 1))))
    )
)

f = 2n
g = 2^n
h = 2^h(n-1) ; note - this is called tetration https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetration
